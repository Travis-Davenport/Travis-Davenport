An aspiring IT professional currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I'm passionate about many things technology but have found great interest in the security side of it and understanding how different attacks work and ways in which to prevent and mitigate them.

## Objective
My journey into cybersecurity is driven by a desire to deepen my understanding of the field through hands-on experience. I'm actively applying my education to real world projects and exploring industry standard tools to gain practical, in depth knowledge.
